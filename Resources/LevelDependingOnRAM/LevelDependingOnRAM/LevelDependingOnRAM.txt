What is that
------------

It is roughly the same as Level Depending On Event.
The level number of an overworld tile changes after a particular RAM address has been set (i.e., it's different than 0). You can freely customize that (see limitations).
You can use both ASM hacks simultaneously. (If changing the same level in both patches, this one will overwrite the other one).

Limitations
-----------

- Levels that are on a submap (level 1xx) but change to a level that is on the OW main map (level 0xx) will screw up with the exits inside the level.

- You can only use level 000-024 and 101-13B.

How to edit
-----------

Just change the list inside the LevelTable.asm file. You can add as many rows as you like.

How to install
--------------

1) Backup your ROM (as a safety measure).

2) You have to save your Overworld in Lunar Magic at least once for this patch to work.

3) Use asar to insert the LevelDependingOnRAM.asm into your ROM (don't patch LevelTable.asm!!)

You dont have to give credit but i appreciate it. Likewise all other ASM hacks I released.
